Or just use SRV as usual They're whats used to validate the server key</p> <p>Would there be two servers, one for users to login/keys, and one for sending/receiving messages? Need to log in to view the messages and decrypt them Would we need client/device keys? Each client to have a key to associate with a user? Existing clients just need password, new clients need MFA to double check its the correct user. Or if reset password.

Just DNSSEC+DANE of directory server domain name, have it run a server with TLS, and respond yes or no to a hash of the email address.</p> <p>Should we support HTML? It can be used as attack vector, scripts, malicious images, tracking pixels etc. Maybe a subset of HTML? Or Gemini?
