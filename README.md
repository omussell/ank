Ank, named after ankylosaurus, armoured dinosaur

End-to-end encrypted messaging

This was/is an ambitious attempt to create a secure messaging service akin to Whatsapp. It intends to use ideas like DANE for storing PKI certificates and takes ideas from Certificate Transparency and applies them to user keys.

It would start small and be based on HTTP requests only so that a CLI/TUI/GUI could be created later.
